# Description
This application has been made to show the skills that I have learned while in school at NSS. We had certain criteria to meet from the instructor such as navbar, footer, about me section, technologies used and projects that we have completed. These are certainly not all projects completed, however, I believe these show a pattern from beginning to this point in front-end technologies. It will continue to be updated as my skills grow.
